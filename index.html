<a href="https://infogram.com/starbucks-fall-drinks?src=web">Link to interactive visualization</a>
<p>The linked data visualization is to a simple pie chart of Starbucks drink preferences. When users hover over each section of the
chart, a label appears next to the user's cursor. WHen the user hovers over the labels in the legend, the non-targeted sections are
tinted to highlight the targeted section. If I were to make this chart in d3, I would add event listener methods to both the label elements
in the key and the sections of the bar chart. Both would check for mouseovers, in the genearal layout of: ".on("mouseover", function(){});"
The event listener for the key labels would select the sections of the pie chart and use the .attr("fill", "color") to reset the color 
of the non-targeted sections to a lighter color. The other event listener would generate a svg element toolkit with the correct label text
when users hover ove the pie chart sections. The function would be similar to the svg tooltip generation method described in the textbook.
Howver, unlike in the textbook method, the tooltip wold have to move with the user's cursor. That would be more difficult to accomplish, and 
I would have to look up additional d3 or JavaScript methods to bind the tooltip to the cursor, so that it can move as the cursor moves.
